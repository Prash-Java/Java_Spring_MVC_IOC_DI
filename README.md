# Java_Spring_MVC_IOC_DI
This project starts with Inversion of Control and implementing it using Dependency Injection,
Entity is created and in the config.xml file, the dependency injection is implemented in the <bean></bean> tag body, with <property> tag having the attributes and the desired values,
The project is being covered using Java Spring MVC,
Spring container requires Beans, configuration of beans with Dependency Injection,
We start with using Setters from Entity class, to implement Dependency Injection,
NOTE: There are basically three sub problems statement for illustrating Dependency injection:
  1.) Employee.java , TestEmployee.java and listconfig.xml file (List)
  2.) CarDealer.java, TestCarDealers.java and setconfig.xml (Set)
  3.) Customer.java, TestCustomers.java and mapconfig.xml (Map)
